RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE.

The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O.

The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.

You can't choose a square that has already been chosen.
